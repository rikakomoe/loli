Leave that stupid git alone and embrace a cute loli.

## Adopt a loli

> 变态们快离本萌远一点。

You wanna have a loli in your disk.
It's pretty easy, just download from GitHub.

```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/bin/loli https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rikakomoe/loli/master/loli.sh
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/loli
```

I bet you always want accompanied by the youngest loli.
Make sure that by checking from time to time.

```bash
loli chira
```

For a more detailed usage, don't hesitate to ask for help.

```bash
loli help
```

## Day and night

> 萝莉有三好——声娇体软易推倒。

Loli does everything git does.

For example,

```bash
loli push
```

## Share your love

> 没有什么是一个拥抱不能解决的，如果有，那就一个吻。

Sometime you wanna discard all your local changes and reset to
the version of the remote. Novice git users often found it struggling
in this case. They even sometimes delete the repository and re-clone.

But with loli, everything is so simple. Give her some love makes it.

```bash
# reset current branch to upstream 
loli hug
# reset current branch to the same branch of remote
loli hug origin
# reset current branch to a specific remote branch
loli hug origin master
```

If a hug doesn't solve the problem, kiss her.

```bash
# this will remove all untracked files.
loli kiss
```

## Keep in touch 

> 请触碰我吧。不要撒谎，触碰您想触碰的位置。这就是我的愿望。

Sometime after you committed and pushed you found there are still bugs.
You then committed and pushed and you found there are still bugs.
And you finally end up with producing a huge number of commits.

Now you have loli handles this for you.
Lift her, touch (stroke) her, and then rub her.

```bash
# git add .
loli lift
```

```bash
# merge current changes into last commit
loli touch
```

```bash
# merge current changes into last commit without showing editor
loli stroke
```

```bash
# git push -f
loli rub
```

If you're frequently driven into this activity, there's a shortcut.

```bash
# loli lift && loli stroke && loli rub
loli suck
```
